Minstall includes some extra scripts, two examples being the benchmark enviroment setup script and the phpmyadmin script.
These scripts may be used independantly to Minstall as they aren't dependant on it but some may require the changing of parameters in the scripts themselves.
Please be sure to understand what each script does and update the variables in the variable section of each script before using.
Hopefully you'll find the scripts useful!
